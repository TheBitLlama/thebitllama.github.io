            <h2>Game fatigue: what is it, and how to counter</h2>
            <p class="alert alert-info">This is an article about FPS games, and only consists advice, I do not take any responsibility of what happens with you, homie.</p>
            <p>I often find myself bottom-fragging in Rainbow: Six Siege after a few matches, even though I got a load of kills upon the start of the gaming session. I thought it was only a bit of inconsistency, but after a few months, I came to a conclusion of what is it, and I worked out a few solutions.</p>
            <p>When I am unable to get kills, I firstly try to register the problem, the cause of the bottom-fragging. Gamers tend to forget about their bodily functions for the duration of the session, so that's the first thing you should check. The best way to do it is to pause, stand up, move a bit, and ask yourself: "Am I hungry? Do I need to pee? Am I sleepy?" If any of the answers is yes, you should get a toilet break, eat/drink some, and go back to playing after 10-15 minutes.</p>
            <p>After you took the break, and still can't do well, you should check if you're tired. You may have all your needs fullfilled, you still won't be able perform, if you're tired. Try to take an hour long nap, or/and drink some coffee.</p>
            <p>If you've done everything that's possible, and still cannot perform any better, the only thing you can do is to take a break from games. I often do game-less weekends, and almost always find myself doing better in Siege after 48 hours of resting.</p>
            <p>I hope I could help you, I tried to share every bit of knowledge I knew!</p>
