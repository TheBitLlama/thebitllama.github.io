            <p>Hey, I'm BitLlama, a hunagrian guy, who spends most of his time gaming, coding, studying, eating and sleeping. I created this site with the sole purpose of sharing information I find useful. I often find myself in situations which are hard to solve, but if I get a solution, I will surely share it here, to ease your life. You can mainly find me on Discord, my username and tag is: BitLlama#1733. Take a look around the site, and have fun! Tip: you may find a <span style="color: #7bbe69">green link</span> in the navbar of the homepage: I indicate temporary links that way, they lead to new content.</p>
